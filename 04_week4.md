## **Day 7: Recap & Mini Project**
- **Review**: Go over everything you’ve learned this week. Focus on any tricky areas in clustering, PCA, or advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Mini Project**:
  - Choose a real dataset (e.g., customer segmentation, Titanic dataset, or handwritten digit classification).
  - Apply **K-means clustering** to group the data, then visualize the results.
  - Use **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the transformed data.
  - If you have time, implement an additional model such as **KNN** or **SVM** and compare it with your clustering results.
  - Document the entire process in a clean Jupyter notebook.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs)**:
- **Review & Recap (4 hrs)**: Go over difficult concepts from this week and revisit the implementation details.
- **Mini Project (4 hrs)**: Work through the project, applying clustering, PCA, and possibly an additional machine learning algorithm.

### **Additional Tips for Week 4**:
- **Practice Coding**: When learning about unsupervised learning, try implementing algorithms from scratch (or using libraries like `scikit-learn`) to solidify your understanding.
- **Visualize Data**: Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing clustering results and PCA transformations to better understand the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Make sure to evaluate your unsupervised models appropriately, using metrics like silhouette score for clustering and variance explained for PCA.
- **Explore Different Datasets**: The more diverse your datasets, the better you will become at choosing and applying the right algorithms.

By the end of Week 4, you’ll have a strong grasp of unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering and PCA, and you will be well-prepared to apply these techniques to real-world problems.
