# Week 5 Plan: Building Projects, Model Evaluation, and Kaggle Competitions

---

## **Day 1-2: Mini Project 1 – Predicting House Prices (Regression)**
- **Objective**: Use a dataset (e.g., Kaggle’s **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**) to predict house prices using regression models.
- **Steps to Follow:**
  1. **Data Exploration**: Load the dataset using **Pandas** and explore the data (check for missing values, outliers, and feature distribution).
  2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features (if needed).
  3. **Model Selection**: Implement and compare multiple regression models (e.g., **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**).
  4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your models using appropriate metrics like **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) or **R²** (R-squared).
  5. **Model Tuning**: Tune the hyperparameters of your models using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.
- **Resources**:
  - Watch tutorials on regression models (e.g., from Kaggle courses or Andrew Ng’s ML course).
  - Use **scikit-learn** for model implementation and evaluation.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:
- **Theory & Exploration (4 hrs)**: Understand the data and explore possible preprocessing steps.
- **Model Implementation & Evaluation (4 hrs)**: Implement regression models and evaluate performance using cross-validation.

## **Day 3-4: Mini Project 2 – Classification of Titanic Survivors (Classification)**
- **Objective**: Use the **Kaggle Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival based on features like age, gender, and class.
- **Steps to Follow:**
  1. **Data Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check for missing values, distributions, and correlations.
  2. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer new features if needed (e.g., combining age and class for better predictions).
  3. **Model Selection**: Implement classification models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **KNN**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
  4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your models using classification metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
  5. **Model Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters and improve your model's performance.
- **Resources**:
  - Watch tutorials on classification models (e.g., Kaggle’s Titanic tutorials or StatQuest).
  - Use **scikit-learn** for implementing and evaluating models.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:
- **Theory & Exploration (4 hrs)**: Explore and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
- **Model Implementation & Evaluation (4 hrs)**: Implement classification models and evaluate using the relevant metrics.

## **Day 5-6: Kaggle Competition – Participate in a Beginner Challenge**
- **Objective**: Start participating in a beginner-level Kaggle competition to practice applying your skills to real-world problems.
- **Steps to Follow:**
  1. **Choose a Competition**: Find a beginner-level competition on Kaggle, such as the **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** or **House Prices** competitions.
  2. **Competition Overview**: Read the competition rules, objectives, and evaluation metrics.
  3. **Data Exploration**: Explore the competition dataset, perform preprocessing, and try initial models.
  4. **Submit Predictions**: Submit your initial predictions and evaluate how well you performed compared to others.
  5. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine your models based on feedback from your submission and Kaggle kernels (public notebooks).
- **Resources**:
  - Kaggle forums and kernels (public notebooks) for inspiration and solutions.
  - Kaggle tutorials and documentation for model training and evaluation.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:
- **Competition Setup (4 hrs)**: Start exploring the competition dataset, set up a notebook, and submit your first predictions.
- **Iteration & Improvement (4 hrs)**: Refine models based on initial feedback and Kaggle kernels.

## **Day 7: Recap & Portfolio Development**
- **Review**: Go over everything you’ve accomplished this week and identify areas for improvement.
- **Portfolio Development**: Document your projects and Kaggle competition submissions:
  1. **Create GitHub Repositories**: Upload your mini-projects (House Price Prediction and Titanic Classification) to GitHub.
  2. **Write ReadMe Files**: Add clear explanations, code comments, and instructions on how to run your models and reproduce your results.
  3. **Project Showcase**: Make your GitHub profile public, so you can share it with potential employers and internships.
- **Next Steps**: Plan your next week, which will focus on advanced topics (e.g., deep learning) or further refining your machine learning models.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs)**:
- **Review & Recap (4 hrs)**: Go over your models and Kaggle submissions, look for improvements.
- **Portfolio Development (4 hrs)**: Upload your projects to GitHub, write documentation, and improve your portfolio.

### **Additional Tips for Week 5**:
- **Practice Submission**: During Kaggle competitions, don’t hesitate to submit early and often. Each submission helps you learn from the community and improve.
- **Documentation**: Make sure your GitHub repositories are well-documented and cleanly organized, showing the entire workflow (from data exploration to model evaluation).
- **Networking**: Connect with other Kaggle participants, learn from their approaches, and explore the Kaggle forums for tips and advice.
- **Iterate**: Keep refining your projects and Kaggle submissions. Continuous improvement is key to mastering machine learning.

By the end of Week 5, you’ll have built two solid projects for your portfolio, participated in a Kaggle competition, and gained hands-on experience in model evaluation and submission. You'll be one step closer to being ready for an internship!
