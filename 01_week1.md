## Day 7: Recap & Mini Project

### Review:
- Go over everything you've learned in the week. Revisit any concepts you found tricky.

### Mini Project:
Apply what you've learned so far to a small dataset:
- Create a Python script to compute the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of a dataset.
- Plot histograms using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the distribution of data.

This will also help you get comfortable with Python libraries.

### Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs):
- **Review & Recap (4 hrs)**: Go over any challenging topics.
- **Mini Project (4 hrs)**: Work with a dataset, compute basic stats, and plot visualizations.

## Additional Tips:
- **Practice Coding**: Use Python for every math concept. Libraries like NumPy and Pandas will help you perform operations easily.
- **Daily Review**: At the end of each day, spend 30 minutes to review the key points to reinforce the learning.
- **Stay Organized**: Keep notes, examples, and solutions to refer to later.
