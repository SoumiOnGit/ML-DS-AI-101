### **Additional Tips for Week 6**:
- **Practice with Real Datasets**: For deep learning, focus on practical datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **MNIST**, or other image datasets for better understanding.
- **Model Tuning**: Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve model performance.
- **Deployment Best Practices**: Understand that deployment goes beyond just training models. Learn how to expose models via APIs and deploy them in production environments using containers like **Docker**.
- **Portfolio Development**: Make sure your deep learning projects are well-documented and showcase both model building and deployment skills.

By the end of Week 6, you’ll have a strong foundation in deep learning, specifically CNNs, and the ability to deploy machine learning models using Flask and Docker. You will also have an advanced mini project that demonstrates your skills in both building and deploying deep learning models.
