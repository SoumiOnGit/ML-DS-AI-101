---

## **Day 1-2: Introduction to Calculus – Derivatives**
- **Concepts to Cover:**
  - **Derivatives**: Understand the concept of a derivative, the rate of change, and how to compute it.
  - **Rules of Differentiation**: Learn about basic rules like the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
  - **Applications of Derivatives**: Learn how derivatives are used to find the slope of a curve, optimization problems, and machine learning models (e.g., gradient descent).
- **Resources:**
  - Watch introductory videos (Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown’s Calculus series).
  - Practice problems (Khan Academy or MIT OpenCourseWare).
  
**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:

## **Day 3-4: Understanding Integrals**
- **Concepts to Cover:**
  - **Indefinite Integrals**: Learn how to integrate functions and understand the anti-derivative.
  - **Definite Integrals**: Study the concept of integrating over a range and its application to area under curves.
  - **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Learn the connection between differentiation and integration.
- **Resources:**
  - Watch videos on integrals (Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown).
  - Practice solving integral problems.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:

## **Day 5-6: Advanced Probability and Statistics**
- **Concepts to Cover:**
  - **Probability Distributions**: Study more advanced probability distributions such as the **binomial distribution**, **Poisson distribution**, and **normal distribution**.
  - **Bayes’ Theorem**: Learn about conditional probability and how Bayes' Theorem is applied in data science and machine learning.
  - **Hypothesis Testing**: Learn about p-values, significance levels, t-tests, and confidence intervals.
- **Resources:**
  - Watch videos on advanced probability distributions and hypothesis testing (Khan Academy, StatQuest).
  - Practice solving problems on distributions and hypothesis testing.

**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs/day)**:

## **Day 7: Recap & Mini Project**
- **Review**: Go over everything you've learned this week, focusing on tricky concepts or areas where you need improvement.
- **Mini Project**: 
  - Implement a **linear regression** model using **Python** (using **NumPy** and **Pandas**) and analyze the dataset.
  - Compute and visualize some basic statistics, e.g., mean, variance, correlation, using **Seaborn**.
  - For the calculus portion, try applying optimization problems in the context of machine learning, such as gradient descent.
  
**Study Time Breakdown (8 hrs)**:
- **Review & Recap (4 hrs)**: Go over any challenging topics.
- **Mini Project (4 hrs)**: Work with a real dataset, perform some statistical analysis, and implement a basic model.

### **Additional Tips for Week 2**:
- **Practice Coding**: When learning calculus, try implementing differentiation and integration using Python libraries like **SymPy**.
- **Hands-on Projects**: Apply probability and statistics to real-world datasets (e.g., Kaggle or open datasets).
- **Daily Review**: Spend 30 minutes each day reviewing what you’ve learned to solidify your understanding.
- **Stay Consistent**: The more you practice, the faster you’ll become at solving problems.

By the end of Week 2, you’ll have a stronger foundation in both calculus and advanced probability/statistics, and you’ll start applying this knowledge to real-world problems.
